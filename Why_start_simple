**Why start simple?**

I write programs with MVP approach â€“ minimum viable projects. There are part parts to consider: client requirements and how to meet the requirements. Create the essentials first! And start simple!
Create, develop, and troubleshoot at the basic level before building additional layers. It minimizes the amount of troubleshooting, rollbacks, and potential errors (and overlooking errors!). A code is more likely to be reusable.
